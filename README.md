👋 I’m Saalik, a builder and writer. Through software, blog posts, poems, and books, I aim to explore unconventional interconnections.

### The Craft

- 💎 I'm a Rubyist, although I love dabbling, and lean on JavaScript often
- 🛤️ I mostly build for the web with Ruby on Rails

I'm on sabbatical, which has given me a lot of space to build fun stuff. I'm interested in exploring new languages, learning more about devops, and understanding new programming paradigms.

### What I'm Up To

- I keep my website fairly up-to-date with my activity: [saaliklok.com](https://saaliklok.com).
- I publish an essay weekly on my blog, [The Spoonful](https://www.thespoonful.dev).
- Want to get in touch? I'm fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saaliklok).
